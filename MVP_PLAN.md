# LogLion - MVP Plan

## Project Overview
LogLion is a Go-based CLI tool that analyzes logcat files to validate analytics event funnels for automated testing.

## MVP Scope
**Focus**: Logcat files (plain text and JSON formats)
**Goal**: Validate single conversion funnel from log files
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for MVP

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Go
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra CLI
- **Config Format**: YAML
- **Log Format**: Logcat (plain text and JSON formats)

## MVP Features

### 1. Core Commands Structure
```
loglion
â”œâ”€â”€ analyze          # Main analysis command
â”œâ”€â”€ validate         # Validate config file
â””â”€â”€ version          # Show version info
```

### 2. Essential Functionality

#### Command: `analyze`
```bash
loglion analyze --config funnel.yaml --log logcat.txt --format logcat-plain
```

**Flags:**
- `--config, -c`: Path to funnel configuration file
- `--log, -l`: Path to log file
- `--format, -f`: Log format preset (default: "logcat-plain")
- `--output, -o`: Output format (json, text) (default: "text")

#### Command: `validate`
```bash
loglion validate --config funnel.yaml
```

### 3. Configuration File Format

```yaml
# funnel.yaml
version: "1.0"
format: "logcat-plain"  # Log format preset

funnel:
  name: "Purchase Flow"

  steps:
    - name: "Product View"
      event_pattern: "page_view"  # Matches JSON "event" field
      required_properties:
        page: "/product"

    - name: "Add to Cart"
      event_pattern: "add_to_cart"  # Matches JSON "event" field
      required_properties:
        product_id: ".*"  # regex pattern

    - name: "Purchase"
      event_pattern: "purchase"  # Matches JSON "event" field
      required_properties:
        transaction_id: ".*"

# Optional: Define how to extract data from logcat files
log_parser:
  timestamp_format: "01-02 15:04:05.000"
  event_regex: ".*Analytics.*: (.*)"
  json_extraction: true  # Try to parse JSON from log line
```

### 4. Output Format

#### Success Case (Text):
```
âœ… Funnel Analysis Complete

Funnel: Purchase Flow
Total Events Analyzed: 247
Funnel Completed: Yes

Step Breakdown:
1. Product View: 15 events (100%)
2. Add to Cart: 8 events (53.3%)
3. Purchase: 3 events (20.0%)

Drop-off Analysis:
- Product View â†’ Add to Cart: 7 events lost (46.7% drop-off)
- Add to Cart â†’ Purchase: 5 events lost (62.5% drop-off)
```

#### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "funnel_name": "Purchase Flow",
  "total_events_analyzed": 247,
  "funnel_completed": true,
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Product View",
      "event_count": 15,
      "percentage": 100.0
    },
    {
      "name": "Add to Cart", 
      "event_count": 8,
      "percentage": 53.3
    },
    {
      "name": "Purchase",
      "event_count": 3, 
      "percentage": 20.0
    }
  ],
  "drop_offs": [
    {
      "from": "Product View",
      "to": "Add to Cart", 
      "events_lost": 7,
      "drop_off_rate": 46.7
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Example Files**: Create sample configuration and logcat files
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing with real log files
3. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance with large log files
4. **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues found during testing

### Enhancement Roadmap
1. **Phase 1: Stability & Examples** (1-2 days)
   - Add example files (funnel.yaml, sample_logcat.txt)
   - Integration testing and bug fixes
   - Performance validation

2. **Phase 2: Extended Features** (1-2 weeks)
   - Multiple funnel analysis in single run
   - Custom log format definitions
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (2-4 weeks)
   - iOS log format support
   - Visual HTML reports
   - Real-time log monitoring
   - CI/CD integration helpers

        page: "/product"
    - name: "Add to Cart"
      event_pattern: "add_to_cart"
      required_properties:

```

**Result**:
```
